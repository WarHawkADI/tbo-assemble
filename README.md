## Problem Statement

India's group travel industry manages **thousands of crore** in hotel room blocks annually — yet most agents still rely on **spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and manual emails**. This leads to:

| Pain Point | Impact |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Missed attrition deadlines | Heavy penalty charges (10–30% of block value) |
| Manual guest allocation | 4–6 hours wasted per event |
| Clunky reservation processes | High booking drop-off rates |
| Zero real-time visibility | Revenue leakage and overcommitment |

---

## Solution

TBO Assemble replaces this chaos with an intelligent, end-to-end platform in three simple steps:

```
1. UPLOAD    → Hotel contract PDF + event invitation
               AI extracts everything in <60 seconds

2. CUSTOMISE → Adjust room blocks, add-ons, attrition rules
               Auto-generates a branded event microsite

3. GO LIVE   → Share the microsite link with guests
               Monitor bookings in real-time, auto-nudge pending guests
```

> **"What takes 3 days manually, TBO Assemble does in 30 minutes."**

---

## Core Features

### 🤖 GenAI Contract Parsing (GPT-4o + Local OCR Fallback)

Upload a hotel contract PDF and event invitation document. Our intelligent extraction pipeline uses:

1. **PDF Text Extraction** — `pdf-parse` extracts text from digital PDFs  
2. **JPEG Page Extraction** — Falls back to image conversion for scanned PDFs  
3. **OCR Processing** — `tesseract.js` with `sharp` preprocessing for image-based documents  
4. **AI Enhancement** — GPT-4o structures the extracted text into event data

The parser extracts room blocks, negotiated rates, check-in/check-out dates, attrition penalties, venue details, and theme colours — generating a fully branded event microsite in under 60 seconds. Includes **OCR correction patterns** for common scan errors (O→0, l→1, currency symbols), **date validation** to filter impossible dates, and **smart year inference** for dates without explicit years.

### 📋 Contract Template Library

Five pre-configured sample contracts for instant demos — no file upload required:

| Template | Type | Venue |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| 🏰 Taj Lake Palace | Destination Wedding | Udaipur |
| 🎯 Marriott Convention | MICE Conference | Bangalore |
| 🏢 ITC Grand Chola | Corporate Retreat | Chennai |
| 💎 Oberoi Amarvilas | Anniversary | Agra |
| 🏖️ La Calypso Resort | College Reunion | Goa |

### 📱 Offline-First Resilience

Both the booking microsite and event creation wizard feature:

- **Network Detection** — Real-time online/offline status monitoring
- **Offline Banner** — Visual indicator when connectivity is lost
- **Form Persistence** — Auto-saves progress to `localStorage` every change
- **Draft Recovery** — Restores interrupted work on page reload (24h for booking, 7 days for events)
- **Graceful Degradation** — Informative error messages for network failures

### 🔄 Cross-Tab Real-Time Sync

Instant dashboard updates when bookings are made from the microsite (even in another browser tab):

- **BroadcastChannel API** — Native browser API for cross-tab communication
- **Auto-Refresh Dashboard** — Event list updates instantly when a new booking is made
- **Check-In Page Sync** — Bookings list refreshes automatically for check-in staff
- **Event Detail Sync** — Server components refresh via `router.refresh()` for accurate stats
- **No Polling Required** — Zero server load, instant updates, works offline-first

### 🏨 Visual Proximity Allocator

Drag-and-drop guest assignment to specific floors, wings, and rooms using `@dnd-kit`. Honours proximity requests ("near the bride's family") with smart visual cues, VIP prioritisation badges, real-time capacity tracking, and AI-powered auto-allocation that explains its reasoning for each placement.

### ⚠️ Smart Yield Protection (Attrition Tracking)

Real-time attrition deadline tracking with visual status timelines. Auto-calculates at-risk revenue in ₹, shows days-until-deadline countdowns, triggers WhatsApp nudges to pending guests, and prevents costly penalties. Visual charts show release dates vs current booking velocity.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
| -------- | --------- |
| **SQLite** | Zero-config deployment — no external database needed for hackathon demo |
| **Prisma 7** | Type-safe database access with `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` |
| **App Router** | `force-dynamic` on API routes for real-time data |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Custom CSS animations (particle network, scroll reveal, tilt cards, shimmer buttons) |
| **Radix UI** | Accessible, unstyled UI primitives for Dialog, Toast, Tabs, Progress, etc. |
| **CVA** | Type-safe component variants for Button and Badge |
| **@dnd-kit** | Modern drag-and-drop for room allocation (replaces react-dnd) |
| **Recharts** | Declarative charts with native dark-mode support |
| **Server-side pricing** | Client cannot manipulate totals — all amounts computed from room rates + add-ons |
| **$transaction everywhere** | Atomic operations for event creation, bookings, bulk check-in |
| **Dark mode** | Class-based toggle with system preference + ThemeScript flash prevention |
| **Mobile-first** | Responsive design across all pages with 44px touch targets |
| **Indian locale** | ₹ currency, Indian names, GST invoicing, WhatsApp integration |
| **i18n** | English + Hindi with localStorage persistence for nation-wide accessibility |
